Hi, I'm Nicolas.


I design software with and for people. 
My background is in anthropology, philosophy, and the natural sciences. 
Most recently, I was at Twitter for over 5 years (2012–2017), 
the last three of which were spent as the progenitor and lead of Twitter’s JavaScript web platform and Twitter Lite.
